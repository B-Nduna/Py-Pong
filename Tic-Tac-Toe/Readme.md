# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when one player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the Game: 
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
   - Run the following command:

    ```
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

2. Instructions:
   - Players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their mark (X or O).
   - The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with rows and columns labeled from 0 to 2.
   - The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
   - If all spaces on the board are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.
